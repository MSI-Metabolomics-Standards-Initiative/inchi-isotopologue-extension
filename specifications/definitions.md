# Definitions:

## Structural Isomer:
A structural isomer or constitutional isomerism - is one of a set of isomeric molecules with the
same molecular formula but with different bonding patterns and atomic organization (i.e. line
formulae - see [https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/C/C01285.html](https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/C/C01285.html) ).

## Stereoisomer:
A stereoisomer is one of a set of isomeric molecules that have the same molecular formula and
sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the configuration of their atoms in
three-dimensional space (see [https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/S/S05984.html](https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/S/S05984.html) ).

## (Extended) Isotopomer:
(Extended) Isotopomer - also known as isotopic isomers, these are isomers
[https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/I/I03289.html](https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/I/I03289.html) with the same number of each isotope of each
element but differing in their positions within the chemical structure. For example, CH<sub>3</sub>CHDCH<sub>3</sub>
( CC([2H])C ) and CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>D ( CCC([2H]) ) are a pair of constitutional isotopomers of propane .
Isotopomers can also be specific to stereochemistry, where they are known as isotopic stereoisomers (e.g. (R)- and (S)-CH3CHDOH - see [https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/I/I03352.html](https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/I/I03352.html) ). 
By definition, isotopomers have the same mass, since they have the same isotopic composition. However, the set of all isotopomers which span
all possible isotopic compositions are often collectively referred to as isotopomers. While
technically inaccurate, it is a pragmatic use of the term to refer to all possible isotopomers
spanning all isotopic compositions for a given chemical entity. Therefore, we will refer to
isotopomer as any isotope-position-distinct isomer of a given chemical entity. The term
“mass-equivalent isotopomer” will be used to refer to the technical definition of isotopomer.

## Mass-equivalent Isotopomer:

We will use this term to refer to the technical definition of an isotopomer (also see above), as one in a collection of isomers with the same number of each isotope of
each element but differing in their positions within the chemical structure.

## Partial Isotopomer - part of an isotopomer where the isotopic content of specific atoms is known.
In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and in rare circumstances in tandem mass
spectrometry, individual spectral features may directly indicate that certain atoms of a particular
molecule have certain isotopes. As an example from NMR, certain analytical features may
indicate that carbon 1 of alpha-D-glucopyranose is 13 C labeled without knowing the isotopic
status of the other carbon atoms.

## Isotopologue:
Isotopologues - representing molecules of the same chemical entity and same isotopic
composition. Related isotopologues represent the same chemical entity but differ in the isotopic
composition (number of isotopic substitutions - see
[https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/I/I03351.html](https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/I/I03351.html) ). The isotopologues of water that span the stable
isotope compositions of hydrogen and oxygen as as follows:

<sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub><sup>16</sup>O,
<sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub>H<sup>16</sup>O,
<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub><sup>16</sup>O

<sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub><sup>17</sup>O,
<sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub>H<sup>17</sup>O,
<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub><sup>17</sup>O

<sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O,
<sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub>H<sup>18</sup>O,
<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O

** A single isotopologue represents a set of mass-equivalent isotopomers ** 
(e.g. <sup>12</sup>C<sub>2</sub>
<sup>1</sup>H<sub>6</sub> has one isotopomer: <sup>12</sup>C<sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup>H<sub>5</sub><sup>2</sup>H has two isotopomers).

## Nominal-Mass Isotopologue:
Nominal-Mass Isotopologue - a set of isotopologues with the same elemental and nucleon
compositions. In many mass spectra, the detected spectral features are not
isotopically-resolved, but are elementally and nucleon resolved, thus representing what we will
term a nominal-mass isotopologue.

## Isotopologue Fragment:
Isotopologue Fragment - a refined set of isotopomers where the ambiguity of isotope location is
limited to a subset of the atoms. This is a subset of the mass-equivalent isotopomers
representing the full isotopologue. Tandem mass spectrometry may provide spectral features
that indicate where (possibly mixed) isotopes are localized within a chemical structure. For
example, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub> may be limited to the glycerol part of a glycerophospholipid and not the fatty acid
chains.
